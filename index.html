    <p>Hey! I'm Arda Serdar Pektezol, a computer engineer with over two years of professional experience as a software engineer specializing in cloud and backend development. Currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>.</p>
    <p>I have liked working with both software and hardware in the past. If something intrigues me, I will research and work on it no matter what. My aim is to be a jack of all trades, master of one.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I work on my personal projects which can be found down below. At the moment, I am working on Tez and LPHUB. I also love playing Go! Check out my profile at <a href="https://www.europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/Player_Card.php?&key=20137469">European Go Database</a>.</p>
